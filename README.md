**Introduction** : Project shows the concept of Golden Ratio i.e. explanation of Golden Ratio expression and spiral formation and as many examples of Golden Ratio in different fields i.e. in Nature, Design, Art and many others and also contains a magical activity by which user can take more interest in mathematics.

Website contains -:

- Home Page – Concept of Golden Ratio with examples
- Examples Page – Application/Examples in different fields with filter
- Activity Page – Contains Magical Activity by the concept of Golden Ratio

**It is a responsive website. Its UI will correctly work on every device.**

**Home Page:** Home page contains the concept of Golden Ratio. This page is showing that what is Golden Ratio and How the Golden Ratio is calculated and forms the spiral with diagrams and examples in a simple way so that the user can easily understand.

**Examples Page:** It contains the examples of Golden Ratio in different fields that is how the person uses Golden Ratio in different fields in different areas and also the examples of Golden ratio in things which are already presented on earth.

It also contains the **filter** so that the user can easily navigate to different fields.

**Activity Page:** It contains the interactive mathematical activity which is showing that how any two random numbers thought by user will give the Golden Ratio. It contains the input area so that the user can give the numbers and can perform this interesting activity.
